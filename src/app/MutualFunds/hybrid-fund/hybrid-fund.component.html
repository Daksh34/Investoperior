            <p style="padding-top: 50px;">Investments can be broadly classified into three types based on risk – equity (or high-risk) investments, debt (or low-risk) investments, and hybrid investments. Most investment advisors ask investors to create an investment plan based on their financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Every individual has different needs and aspirations and hence it is difficult to classify an investor as a purely high-risk or low-risk-taker. This is where Hybrid Mutual Funds step in. here, we will explore Hybrid Funds and talk about some essential features that you need to know before investing in them.</p>

                                        As the name suggests, hybrid funds are a combination of equity and debt investments which are designed to meet the investment objective of the scheme. Each hybrid fund has a different combination of equity and debt targeted at different types of investors.

                                    <p>Hybrid funds are considered to be riskier than debt funds but safer than equity funds. They tend to offer better returns than debt funds and are preferred by many low-risk investors. Further, new investors who are unsure about stepping into the equity markets tend to turn towards hybrid funds. This is because the debt component offers stability while they test the equity ‘waters’. Hybrid funds allow investors to make the most out of equity investments while cushioning themselves against extreme volatility in the market.</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>An equity-oriented hybrid fund invests at least 65% of its total assets in equity and equity-related instruments of companies across various market capitalizations and sectors. The remaining 35% is invested in debt securities and money market instruments.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3><span id="Investment_Strategy-based_Categorization"><b>Debt-oriented Hybrid Funds</b></span></h3>

                                        <li>A debt-oriented hybrid fund invests at least 60% of its total assets in fixed-income securities like bonds, debentures, government securities, etc. The remaining 40% is invested in equity. Some funds also invest a small part of their corpus in liquid schemes.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>These funds invest a minimum of 65% of their total assets in equity and equity-related instruments and the rest in debt securities and cash. For taxation, they are considered to be equity funds and offer tax exemption on long-term capital gains of up to Rs. 1 lakh. The fixed income component makes it a good option for equity investors as it helps mitigate the volatility of equity investments.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>Monthly Income Plans are hybrid funds which primarily invest in fixed income securities and allocate a small portion of their corpus to equity and equity-related instruments. This allows these plans to generate better returns than pure debt schemes and allows the fund to offer regular income to investors. Most plans also offer a growth option where the income grows in the fund’s corpus.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>Arbitrage funds buy stocks at a lower price in one market and sell it at a higher price in another. The fund manager constantly keeps looking for arbitrage opportunities and maximize the fund’s returns. However, there are times when good arbitrage opportunities are not available. During such times, the fund invests primarily in debt securities and cash. Arbitrage funds are considered to be as safe as debt funds. However, long-term capital gains are taxed like equity funds.</li>

                                    <p>Here are some important aspects that you must consider before investing in hybrid funds in India:</p>
                                    <h3><span id="Investment_Strategy-based_Categorization"><b>The Risk-Return Assessment</b></span></h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Hybrid funds carry an investment risk proportionate to the allocation of assets in its portfolio. Hence, it is important to analyze the portfolio of the scheme carefully to get a good understanding of the risks involved. For example, if you are investing in an equity-oriented hybrid fund, then you must look at the kind of stocks the fund owns. Are the majorly large-caps or small/mid-caps? This helps you understand the risks better. Further, it will also give you an idea of the kind of returns that you can expect.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3><span id="Investment_Strategy-based_Categorization"><b>Choose the right Hybrid Fund</b></span></h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Since hybrid funds come in different types, it is important to consider your risk tolerance, financial goals, and investment horizon before choosing a scheme. If you need regular income, then opting for a debt-oriented hybrid fund might offer better returns than a pure debt fund due to the added equity component. Ensure that you consider these factors before investing.</li>

You could check the track record of the mutual fund house and the fund manager before investing in the mutual fund. However, you may invest in the mutual fund only if you are comfortable with the investment style of the fund manager. <br><br>You must check the expense ratio before putting your money in the mutual fund. You may find the best mutual funds having a lower expense ratio. However, you must check other important parameters before investing in the mutual fund. You would find the best mutual funds have a lower turnover ratio for the portfolio. You may avoid mutual funds where the fund manager churns the portfolio many times. <br><br>You may pick the best mutual funds depending on your investment horizon. You could invest in equity funds only if you have an investment horizon of three years or more. You may invest in debt funds for a shorter time horizon of under three years. Invest in balanced or hybrid funds only if you have an investment horizon of three to five years. <br><br>You may measure the performance of mutual funds against a benchmark index to select the best mutual funds. For example, you may check the performance of a large-cap fund against the Nifty 50. Compare the performance of the mutual fund against its peers and also take a look at the consistency of performance. Best mutual funds have a consistent track record of outperforming peers and the benchmark index over five years or more. <br><br>You must choose the best mutual fund house with large assets under management (AUM). The fund house may be able to bear sudden redemption pressure if it has large assets under management.</div>

                                                    <div itemprop="text"><strong>Best performing equity fund: </strong> <br>An equity mutual fund may be the best performer in its category if it consistently beats the benchmark index over some time. The best performing equity fund has a lower expense ratio as compared to peers. You may find the best performing mutual funds doing well across market cycles. <br><br>You must check the alpha of the equity fund to identify the best performing mutual fund. It shows the excess return generated by the equity fund above the benchmark index. You can pick the equity fund with a high alpha as compared to the peers. <br><br>You must take a look at the beta of the equity fund. It gives you an idea of the volatility of the fund as compared to the benchmark index. An equity fund with a beta less than one is less volatile as compared to a fund with a beta more than one. <br><br>Take a look at standard deviation which gives you an idea of the volatility of the equity fund. You may find an equity fund with a higher standard deviation to be riskier as compared to a fund with lower standard deviation. You may pick the best performing equity fund based on risk-adjusted returns. Check the Sharpe’s ratio of the equity fund and opt for an equity mutual fund scheme with a higher Sharpe’s ratio which signifies a higher risk-adjusted return. <br><br><strong>Best performing debt fund:</strong> <br>You may consider picking the best debt funds based on the credit quality of the bonds in the portfolio. Credit rating agencies would assign a credit rating to bond-issuers based on their ability to repay the principal and interest amounts. You must invest in debt funds with AAA-rated bonds in the portfolio. <br><br>It is a safer investment as compared to bonds of a lower rating which may offer a higher interest rate. However, they could default on both principal and interest payments. <br><br>You may select the best performing debt fund based on the expense ratio. You must not pick a debt fund with a high expense ratio. Best debt funds have an excellent track record of performance over three to five years. You may select the best debt fund where the average maturity period matches your investment horizon. <br><br><strong>Best performing hybrid fund:</strong> <br>You could pick the best performing hybrid fund with a good track record of performance over three to five years. Select a hybrid fund which has beaten the benchmark index and peers over some time. <br><br>You may check the track record of the fund house and the investment style of the fund manager before picking the best performing hybrid fund. Pick a fund house with huge assets under management which can bear the sudden redemption pressure of big investors. <br><br>Select the best performing hybrid fund with a low expense ratio. A high expense ratio may eat up the return from the fund. The best performing hybrid funds must match your investment objectives and risk tolerance. Take a look at the portfolio of conservative hybrid funds. It gives you an idea on the credit quality of bonds in the portfolio.</div>
