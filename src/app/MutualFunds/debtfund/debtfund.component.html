                                        Debt funds invest in securities which generate fixed income like treasury bills, corporate bonds, commercial papers, government securities, and many other money market instruments. All these instruments have a pre-decided maturity date and interest rate that the buyer can earn on maturity – hence the name fixed-income securities. The returns are usually not affected by fluctuations in the market. Therefore, debt securities are considered to be low-risk investment options.

                                    <p>Every debt security has a credit rating which allows investors to understand the possibility of default by the debt issuer in disbursing the principal and interest. Debt fund managers use these ratings to select high-quality debt instruments. A higher rating implies that the issuer is less likely to default.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><b>The next logical question is: </b>Do Debt Funds also invest in low-quality debt instruments?</p>
                                    <p>The answer is yes. Fund managers select securities based on various factors. Sometimes, choosing low-quality debt security offers an opportunity to earn higher returns on debt investments and the fund manager takes a calculated risk. However, a debt fund which has high-quality securities in its portfolio will be more stable. Further, the fund manager can choose to invest in long-term or short-term debt securities depending on whether the interest rate regime is falling or rising.</p>

                                    <p>Debt funds are highly recommended to investors with lower risk tolerance. Debt funds usually diversify across various securities to ensure stable returns. While there are no guarantees, the returns are usually in an expected range. Hence, low-risk investors find them ideal. Debt funds are also available for:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Short-term investors (3-12 months) </b>– Rather than keeping your funds in a regular savings account, you can invest in liquid funds which offer 7-9% returns. Also, you do not compromise on liquidity.</li>
                                        <li><b>Medium-term investors (3-5 years) </b>– If you want to invest in a low-risk instrument for 3-5 years, the first thing that probably comes to mind is a bank fixed deposit. Investing in a dynamic bond fund for a similar tenure tend to offer better returns than FDs. Also, if you need monthly payouts (like interest in FDs), you can opt for a Monthly Income Plan. </li>

                                        <li><b>Liquid Fund </b>– which invests in money market instruments having a maturity of maximum 91 days. Liquid funds tend to offer better returns than savings accounts and are a good alternative for short-term investments.</li>
                                        <li><b>Money Market Fund </b>– which invests in money market instruments with a maximum maturity of 1 year. These funds are good for investors seeking low-risk debt securities for a short-term.</li>
                                        <li><b>Dynamic Bond Fund </b>– which invests in debt instruments of varying maturities based on the interest rate regime. These funds are good for investors with moderate risk tolerance and an investment horizon of 3 to 5 years.</li>
                                        <li><b>Corporate Bond Fund </b>– which invests a minimum of 80% of its total assets in corporate bonds having the highest ratings. These funds are good for investors with lower risk tolerance and seeking to invest in high-quality corporate bonds.</li>
                                        <li><b>Banking and PSU Fund </b>– which invests at least 80& of its total assets in debt securities of PSUs (public sector undertakings) and banks.</li>
                                        <li><b>Gilt Fund </b>– which invests a minimum of 80% of its investible corpus in government securities across varying maturities. These funds do not carry any credit risk. However, the interest rate risk is high. </li>
                                        <li><b>Credit Risk Fund </b>– which invests a minimum of 65% of its investible corpus in corporate bonds having ratings below the highest quality corporate bonds. Therefore, these funds carry an amount of credit risk and offer slightly better returns than the highest quality bonds.</li>
                                        <li><b>Floater Fund </b>– which invests a minimum of 65% of its investible corpus in floating rate instruments. These funds carry a low interest-rate risk.</li>

                                        Factors to consider before investing in Arbitrage Mutual Funds in India
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Here are some important aspects that you must consider before investing in debt funds in India:</p>
                                    <h3><span id="Investment_Strategy-based_Categorization"><b>Risks in Debt Funds</b></span></h3>
                                    <p>Debts funds fundamentally carry three types of risks:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Credit Risk </b>– which is the default risk of the issuer not repaying the principal and interest.</li>
                                        <li><b>Interest Rate Risk </b>– which is the effect of changing interest rates on the value of the scheme’s securities. </li>
                                        <li><b>Liquidity Risk </b>– which is the risk carried by the fund house of not having adequate liquidity to meet redemption requests.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3><span id="Investment_Strategy-based_Categorization"><b>Returns</b></span></h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Debt funds offer lower returns as compared to equity funds. Also, there is no guarantee of the returns. The NAV of debt funds fluctuates with changes in the interest rate. If the interest rates rise, then the NAV of a debt fund falls and vice-versa.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3><span id="Investment_Strategy-based_Categorization"><b>Expense Ratio</b></span></h3>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This is an important aspect while investing in debt funds. The expense ratio is a percentage of the fund’s total assets which a fee towards fund management services. Since the returns in debt funds are not very high, a high expense ratio can dent your earnings. Look for schemes with a lower expense ratio and stay invested for a longer-term.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Debt funds are available for all durations – from 1 day (overnight funds) to 7+ years (long duration funds). Therefore, you must choose as per your financial goals and investment horizon. Many investors turn towards debt funds for regular income. Some savvy investors dedicate a portion of their investment portfolio to debt for adding stability. Whatever be the reason, ensure that you invest according to your investment plan.</p>
                                    <p><b>Taxation for Debt Funds</b></p>

You could check the track record of the mutual fund house and the fund manager before investing in the mutual fund. However, you may invest in the mutual fund only if you are comfortable with the investment style of the fund manager. <br><br>You must check the expense ratio before putting your money in the mutual fund. You may find the best mutual funds having a lower expense ratio. However, you must check other important parameters before investing in the mutual fund. You would find the best mutual funds have a lower turnover ratio for the portfolio. You may avoid mutual funds where the fund manager churns the portfolio many times. <br><br>You may pick the best mutual funds depending on your investment horizon. You could invest in equity funds only if you have an investment horizon of three years or more. You may invest in debt funds for a shorter time horizon of under three years. Invest in balanced or hybrid funds only if you have an investment horizon of three to five years. <br><br>You may measure the performance of mutual funds against a benchmark index to select the best mutual funds. For example, you may check the performance of a large-cap fund against the Nifty 50. Compare the performance of the mutual fund against its peers and also take a look at the consistency of performance. Best mutual funds have a consistent track record of outperforming peers and the benchmark index over five years or more. <br><br>You must choose the best mutual fund house with large assets under management (AUM). The fund house may be able to bear sudden redemption pressure if it has large assets under management.</div>

                                                    <div itemprop="text"><strong>Best performing equity fund: </strong> <br>An equity mutual fund may be the best performer in its category if it consistently beats the benchmark index over some time. The best performing equity fund has a lower expense ratio as compared to peers. You may find the best performing mutual funds doing well across market cycles. <br><br>You must check the alpha of the equity fund to identify the best performing mutual fund. It shows the excess return generated by the equity fund above the benchmark index. You can pick the equity fund with a high alpha as compared to the peers. <br><br>You must take a look at the beta of the equity fund. It gives you an idea of the volatility of the fund as compared to the benchmark index. An equity fund with a beta less than one is less volatile as compared to a fund with a beta more than one. <br><br>Take a look at standard deviation which gives you an idea of the volatility of the equity fund. You may find an equity fund with a higher standard deviation to be riskier as compared to a fund with lower standard deviation. You may pick the best performing equity fund based on risk-adjusted returns. Check the Sharpe’s ratio of the equity fund and opt for an equity mutual fund scheme with a higher Sharpe’s ratio which signifies a higher risk-adjusted return. <br><br><strong>Best performing debt fund:</strong> <br>You may consider picking the best debt funds based on the credit quality of the bonds in the portfolio. Credit rating agencies would assign a credit rating to bond-issuers based on their ability to repay the principal and interest amounts. You must invest in debt funds with AAA-rated bonds in the portfolio. <br><br>It is a safer investment as compared to bonds of a lower rating which may offer a higher interest rate. However, they could default on both principal and interest payments. <br><br>You may select the best performing debt fund based on the expense ratio. You must not pick a debt fund with a high expense ratio. Best debt funds have an excellent track record of performance over three to five years. You may select the best debt fund where the average maturity period matches your investment horizon. <br><br><strong>Best performing hybrid fund:</strong> <br>You could pick the best performing hybrid fund with a good track record of performance over three to five years. Select a hybrid fund which has beaten the benchmark index and peers over some time. <br><br>You may check the track record of the fund house and the investment style of the fund manager before picking the best performing hybrid fund. Pick a fund house with huge assets under management which can bear the sudden redemption pressure of big investors. <br><br>Select the best performing hybrid fund with a low expense ratio. A high expense ratio may eat up the return from the fund. The best performing hybrid funds must match your investment objectives and risk tolerance. Take a look at the portfolio of conservative hybrid funds. It gives you an idea on the credit quality of bonds in the portfolio.</div>
