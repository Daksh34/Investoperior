                                    As the name suggests, Equity Funds invest in the shares of different companies. The fund manager tries to offer great returns by spreading his investment across companies from different sectors or with varying market capitalizations. Typically, equity funds are known to generate better returns than term deposits or debt-based funds. There is an amount of risk associated with these funds since their performance depends on various market conditions.

                                        <li>Focused Equity Fund – This fund invests in a maximum of 30 stocks of companies having market capitalization as specified at the time of the launch of the scheme.</li>
                                        <li><a href="https://groww.in/p/equity-funds/contra-mutual-funds/">Contra Equity Fund </a>– As the name suggests, these schemes follow a contrarian strategy of investing. These schemes analyze the market to find under-performing stocks and purchase them at low prices under the assumption that these stocks will recover in the long term.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>Some schemes might decide to invest in companies with specific market capitalizations only. Here are the common types:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://groww.in/p/equity-funds/large-cap-mutual-funds/">Large-Cap Funds</a> – which typically invest a minimum of 80% of their total assets in equity shares of large-cap companies (the top 100). These schemes are considered to be more stable than the mid-cap or small-cap focused funds.</li>
                                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://groww.in/p/equity-funds/mid-cap-mutual-funds/">Mid-Cap Funds</a> – which usually invest around 65% of their total assets in equity shares of mid-cap companies (101-250th placed companies according to market capitalization). These schemes tend to offer better returns than the large-cap schemes but are also more volatile than them.</li>
                                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://groww.in/p/equity-funds/small-cap-mutual-funds/">Small-Cap Funds</a> – which typically invest around 65% of their total assets in equity shares of small-cap companies (251st and below placed companies according to market capitalization). This is a huge list and more than 95% of all companies in India fall into this category. These schemes tend to offer great returns than the large-cap and mid-cap schemes but are also highly volatile.</li>

In these schemes, the fund manager keeps rebalancing the portfolio to match the market and economic conditions as well as the investment objective of the scheme.</li>
                                        <li style="font-weight: 400;">Large and Mid-Cap Funds – which usually invest around 35% of their total assets in equity shares of mid-cap companies and 35% in large-cap companies. These schemes offer a great blend of lower volatility and better returns.</li>

The balance amount can be invested in money market instruments or debt securities as per the investment objective of the scheme. Further, the fund manager can choose to invest in a growth-oriented or value-oriented manner and select companies according to his assessment of the investment generating maximum returns.</p>

                                    <p>Like any other investment decision, you must assess your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon carefully before signing the dotted line. For the sake of understanding, we have divided the investors into two broad categories – the new entrants and seasoned investors.</p>
                                    <p><b>If you are investing in Equity Funds for the first time…</b></p>
                                    <p>Many new investors are wary of investing in the capital market since they are little capital to invest (young investors) or lack time to constantly monitor their investments (a must for share investments) or lack the expertise to choose the right shares. Hence, they turn to equity mutual funds. However, there are many <b>types of equity funds</b> available and choosing the right one can still be a challenge. We recommend most new investors to opt for Large-Cap Equity Funds. These schemes typically invest in the shares of the best companies in the market and have a history of generating consistent returns.</p>
                                    <p><b>If you are a seasoned investor…</b></p>
                                    <p>There is nothing much that we can say that you don’t already know! However, we recommend you to opt for diversified equity funds and take calculated risks. Your understanding of the market can help you choose the right scheme and earn higher returns as compared to other equity funds.</p>

                                    <p>Here are some salient features of Equity Mutual Funds in India:</p>
                                    <p><b>Lower Expense Ratio&nbsp;</b></p>
                                    <p>In an Equity Fund, regular buying and selling of shares can lead to an increase in the expense ratio of the scheme. The Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI) has created an upper limit for the expense ratio of equity funds at 2.5%. Also, SEBI might reduce it further. This means more returns for investors.</p>
                                    <p><b>Tax Exemption under Section 80C</b></p>
                                    <p>The Equity Linked Savings Scheme or ELSS offers tax exemption under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act with exposure to equity. It has a small lock-in period of 3 years and offers great potential for earning good returns. You can also invest in an ELSS in installments.</p>
                                    <p><b>Portfolio Diversification</b></p>
                                    <p>Equity Funds allow you to gain exposure to several good equity shares by investing a small amount. Hence, your equity portfolio is diversified and offers a better opportunity of earning good returns.</p>

                                    <p>Equity Funds allow you to invest in the capital market without having to worry about choosing individual stocks or sectors. Traditionally, investors with a sound knowledge of the market would earn great returns in the equity market. However, Equity Mutual Funds employ expert fund managers to research for you.

                                    <p>When you decide to invest, apart from other choices, a big question faced by you is choosing between a lump sum and SIP investment plan.</p>
                                    <p>Lumpsum investment means that you invest the entire amount together. For example, if you want to buy units worth Rs. 5 lakh, then you can debit your bank account by the said amount and purchase the units. On the other hand, an SIP or Systematic Investment Plan means that you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals.</p>
                                    <p>Both <a href="https://groww.in/p/lump-sum/">lumpsum</a> and <a href="https://groww.in/p/sip-systematic-investment-plan/">SIP</a> investing have their pros and cons. A lumpsum investor needs to invest at the right time to earn good returns. The risk is that if he times it wrong, then the returns can be lesser or he might even book losses. SIP investing helps mitigate this risk by allowing you to invest the same amount spread across a large period. This makes SIP investing affordable and flexible while inculcating the habit of investment discipline in you. Further, SIP investing also helps you benefit from Rupee Cost Averaging (RCA) where the average cost of purchasing a single unit reduces with time and you are safeguarded from market fluctuations.</p>

You may find the best mutual funds having a lower expense ratio. However, you must check other important parameters before investing in the mutual fund. You would find the best mutual funds have a lower turnover ratio for the portfolio. You may avoid mutual funds where the fund manager churns the portfolio many times. <br><br>You may pick the best mutual funds depending on your investment horizon. You could invest in equity funds only if you have an investment horizon of three years or more. You may invest in debt funds for a shorter time horizon of under three years. Invest in balanced or hybrid funds only if you have an investment horizon of three to five years. <br><br>You may measure the performance of mutual funds against a benchmark index to select the best mutual funds. For example, you may check the performance of a large-cap fund against the Nifty 50. Compare the performance of the mutual fund against its peers and also take a look at the consistency of performance. Best mutual funds have a consistent track record of outperforming peers and the benchmark index over five years or more. <br><br>You must choose the best mutual fund house with large assets under management (AUM).

                                                    <div itemprop="text"><strong>Best performing equity fund: </strong> <br>An equity mutual fund may be the best performer in its category if it consistently beats the benchmark index over some time. The best performing equity fund has a lower expense ratio as compared to peers. You may find the best performing mutual funds doing well across market cycles. <br><br>You must check the alpha of the equity fund to identify the best performing mutual fund. It shows the excess return generated by the equity fund above the benchmark index. You can pick the equity fund with a high alpha as compared to the peers. <br><br>You must take a look at the beta of the equity fund. It gives you an idea of the volatility of the fund as compared to the benchmark index. An equity fund with a beta less than one is less volatile as compared to a fund with a beta more than one. <br><br>Take a look at standard deviation which gives you an idea of the volatility of the equity fund. You may find an equity fund with a higher standard deviation to be riskier as compared to a fund with lower standard deviation. You may pick the best performing equity fund based on risk-adjusted returns. Check the Sharpe’s ratio of the equity fund and opt for an equity mutual fund scheme with a higher Sharpe’s ratio which signifies a higher risk-adjusted return. <br><br><strong>Best performing debt fund:</strong> <br>You may consider picking the best debt funds based on the credit quality of the bonds in the portfolio. Credit rating agencies would assign a credit rating to bond-issuers based on their ability to repay the principal and interest amounts. You must invest in debt funds with AAA-rated bonds in the portfolio. <br><br>It is a safer investment as compared to bonds of a lower rating which may offer a higher interest rate. However, they could default on both principal and interest payments. <br><br>You may select the best performing debt fund based on the expense ratio. You must not pick a debt fund with a high expense ratio. Best debt funds have an excellent track record of performance over three to five years. You may select the best debt fund where the average maturity period matches your investment horizon. <br><br><strong>Best performing hybrid fund:</strong> <br>You could pick the best performing hybrid fund with a good track record of performance over three to five years. Select a hybrid fund which has beaten the benchmark index and peers over some time. <br><br>You may check the track record of the fund house and the investment style of the fund manager before picking the best performing hybrid fund. Pick a fund house with huge assets under management which can bear the sudden redemption pressure of big investors. <br><br>Select the best performing hybrid fund with a low expense ratio. A high expense ratio may eat up the return from the fund. The best performing hybrid funds must match your investment objectives and risk tolerance. Take a look at the portfolio of conservative hybrid funds. It gives you an idea on the credit quality of bonds in the portfolio.</div>
